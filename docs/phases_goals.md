# Research & Development phases & goals
The goal of this document is identifying possible phases and the questions that we want answered in order to proceed to the next phase. These various questions also serve the purpose of effective collaboration where questions can be divided and parallelized amongt contributors.

# Phase 1 - What data?
Before we really start developing something there it’s important to do some qualitative research that will guide future efforts in scoping and focussing the collection of data. 

This should primarily answer the question: **_what initiatives & data should we focus on in the development and deployment of a data platform for it to be valuable for LOT-C?_**

* Which types of initiatives are deployed by what kind of organisation?
* What type(s) of help do they offer, where, how much (supply & demand), how are they doing this, to whom, since when, do they offer it for free?
* Which types of initiatives or organisations are out of scope?
  * For now the offerings of medical and PPE equipment by alternative suppliers is out of scope since this is already being tracked in another system.
* What kind of data is relevant in answering the needs / questions?
* What are the data questions needs in the first place?
* What are CodeForNL data scientists interested in?
* What are the needs of this initiative (apart from help)?
* What kind of data over time data is available / can they offer?
* Can we make a rough estimate using extrapolation of the data on the amount of initiatives that could be there on a national scale?

**Goal:** Collect 250 initiatives and have a smaller representative collection researched with the qualitative questions.

# Phase 2 - How are we going to collect the data on a national scale?
Now that we have an idea of the type(s) of data we can collect the question is:

**_How are we actually going to get the desired data in a system as effective as possible?_**

* What methods are there to source the initiatives and relevant data?
  * What is needed to implement a particular method on a regional (MVP) and national level? Possible sensible to split this up amongst different persons.
    * Organisation
    * People / roles
    * Time estimate
    * Functionality
  * What are the pro’s and cons of this method?
* Which existing data sources or systems are already out there that we can use and or extend?
  * To which extent do identified methods fit this system?
  * Which changes and additions are needed to make it fit?
* What’s the plan & process to do a small scale collection test and what are our expectations for this so we can validate the outcome.
* What meta-data on our own system will aid in analysis?
* What output will we generate for initial validation on the part of data consumers?

**Goal:** Have a prototype which houses 500 initiatives.

# Phase 3 - Small scale collection
This phase is primarily focused on testing tools & procedures and figuring out where improvements need to be made.

Primary question here is: **_What is needed to implement this on a national scale?_**

* What outcome is and is not in line with initial expectations?
* How much time & effort was required?
* Where was there waste in the collection process?
* What should functionally be improved to reduce that?
* What is the quality of the data?
* What is missing in the data model?
* Which functions are most important and valuable for a large scale deployment?

While making small scale improvements we could repeat the small scale process in another region with low hanging fruit adaptations.

**Goal:** Have a first version which houses 600-750 initiatives (preferably with more specific data)

# Phase 4 - National scale collection
Now that we have the functionality in place to do a full scale test we can repeat the questions of phase 3.

**Goal:** Have a first version which houses 1500 - 2500 initiatives with more specific data included.

# Phase 5 - Increase mutual value
By now the collection process is probably starting to run smoothly. We can now start to understand how this data can be used in a reciprocal manner to provide value to the initiatives.

**Goal:** Have a first version which houses 1500 - 2500 initiatives with more specific data included.
